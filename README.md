# ~~TF2~~ CS:GO Econ Data

A library to get ~~TF2~~ CS:GO item data from game memory, intended as a successor to
~~TF2ItemsInfo and TF2IDB~~ CS:GO Items API.
No more parsing the schema file and maintaining your own structure for plugin support.

I got bored one day and thought ~~about rewriting a few of my internal plugins so they didn't
depend on external tooling anymore~~ I'd monopolize the econ library econsystem.  get dunked on
